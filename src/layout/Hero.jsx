            This page introduces you to the issues surrounding child labour. It
            explains what child labour is, where and why children work and how
            working can prevent them from going to school and trap them in a
            cycle of poverty.

            What is child labour?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-black">
            Child labour is a global issue that prevents children from
            fulfilling their potential. Child labour is a violation of
            children’s rights – the work can harm them mentally or physically,
            expose them to hazardous situations or stop them from going to
            school.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            Not all work done by children is classed as child labour. There is
            not an issue when a child is working to progress their life skills
            without compromising their health, their well-being or their
            education. Often older children may do chores for their parents or
            small jobs to earn pocket money or gain work experience. This work
            prepares them for their adult working life.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            But around the world, millions of children do work in child labour.
            They work in fields, in factories, down mines, as servants or maids,
            or selling goods in the street or at markets. Girls are more likely
            than boys to do domestic work, such as cleaning, making food and
            serving.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            The work that children can be forced to do might also be illegal –
            such as working with drug gangs or in prostitution. Many children
            may get no money for the work they do but they will get food and a
            place to sleep. If they become sick or injured, most children will
            not get any money for missing work.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            All these forms of child labour can prevent a child from going to
            school and limit their opportunity to fulfil their potential. Many
            child labourers never go to school or drop out
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            Education is a proven strategy for reducing child labour. Lack of
            access to education keeps the cycle of exploitation, illiteracy and
            poverty going – limiting future options and forcing children to
            accept low-wage work as adults and to raise their own children in
            poverty. Children who have access to education can break the cycle
            of poverty at the root of child labour.

            Child labour is not always illegal
          </h1>
          <p className="text-black">
            In many countries children working under the age of 18 is illegal –
            but not in all. Families and employers often hide what they are
            doing because they worry they will be taken to court or sent to
            prison for having child labourers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            There are 46 countries who do not have laws to protect children
            under 18 from doing dangerous work.

            How many child labourers are there?

          <p className="text-black">
            The International Labour Organization said in 2017 that about 152
            million children aged from five to 17 – 64 million girls and 88
            million girls – are engaged in child labour.

          <p className="text-black">
            Many of them never go to school or drop out of school because they
            are required to work to earn a living for their families or have to
            work to survive themselves. The ILO said 70% work in agriculture,
            17% in the services sector and 12% in industry.

            Why do children work?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-black">
            Poverty, discrimination and marginalisation are the main drivers of
            child labour. Children in poor circumstances work because work is
            seen as the best use of their time in contributing to the needs of
            the family and preparing them for the life they are expected to
            lead.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            Poverty leads millions of children into paying jobs or – especially
            for young girls – domestic work that may even be unpaid but removes
            the burden of feeding and housing the child.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            In emergency situations – during or after conflicts or natural
            disasters – families who have had to flee from their homes often
            have to use their children to earn money just to pay for food.

            What countries have child labourers?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-black">
            Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan have the highest number of child
            labourers. They have also been affected for many years by wars and
            conflicts and have the highest numbers of children not at school.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            Years of conflict in Syria has seen a dramatic increase in poverty
            among Syrian families and forced more children into the labour
            force, especially as refugees face restrictions to legal work from
            host country governments.

            Child labourers doing hazardous jobs
          </h1>
          <p className="text-black">
            At least 85 million children do very hazardous work – forced labour,
            trafficking and bonded labour.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            Mining is one of the most dangerous jobs across the world but about
            one million children work in mines in appalling conditions that can
            lead to injury or death.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            Children also work on building sites and in brick-making factories
            without proper health and safety rules. Children are at risk from
            machinery, chemicals, harsh working conditions and lots of other
            hazards.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black">
            Those who are forced to become soldiers or are slaves are treated
            very badly and suffer terrible physical and mental harm and abuse,
            as well as sexual exploitation. Child domestic workers are also at
            risk of sexual abuse and violence.
